      I love creating ceremonies that feel personal, fun, and true to each
      couple's story. Whether you're planning a big celebration or a small,
      intimate gathering, I'll make sure your ceremony feels relaxed, memorable,
      and completely yours.

      Kate, we had the most incredible time with you as our celebrant! It meant
      so much that we got to be your very first married couple, especially after
      being friends with you for such a long time. You brought just the right
      mix of officialism and humour, which was exactly what we wanted for our
      special day. Even though our ceremony was small, with only five people,
      you made it feel so meaningful and memorable. We're so thankful you were
      such a big part of it all; we honestly couldn't have asked for anyone
      better.

      I became a celebrant in November 2023. After performing my first wedding
      for two very close friends, I quickly realised how special, and how much
      of an honour it is to be part of someone's big day.


      I love working with couples to ensure their ceremony is just how they
      imagined it. Working closely with each couple has shown me that everyone's
      story is unique, but the one thing they all have in common is wanting to
      celebrate their love with the people who matter most.

      Not many people get to marry their special someone amidst a state of
      emergency (the worst weather event recorded in Dunedin), but Kate made it
      happen! Our special day was intimate and memorable! Waves crashing, rain
      pouring, and a world for just the two of us; the whole beach to ourselves
      with Kate and our witnesses. Clad in a rain jacket and gum boots, Kate
      held my umbrella and delivered a heartwarming, short and sweet ceremony.
      To be able to take age-old sentences and make them unique to one couple is
      true talent. We will always cherish Kate, and highly recommend!

      I have performed intimate ceremonies with only a handful of guests, as
      well as larger celebrations where everyone travels from near and far to
      share in the love.

      We are so grateful that Kate officiated our wedding in November 2024. From
      the very beginning, she made us feel comfortable and took the time to
      truly understand our vision for the day. Her words during the ceremony
      were heartfelt and beautifully captured our story, making the moment
      unforgettable for us and our guests. We couldn't have asked for a more
      perfect wedding celebrant and wholeheartedly recommend Kate to anyone
      looking for a warm, thoughtful, and genuine presence on their wedding day.

              My job as a celebrant is to work with each couple to craft their
              ideal ceremony. I work with you to create something that feels
              completely personal. I get to know you as a couple, which helps
              shape the words and the flow, and on the day I guide everything so
              you can relax and just be in the moment. I also ensure all
              paperwork is correct, and ready to send to the BDM register.

              The earlier the better! Most couples get in touch six to twelve
              months before their wedding, but I've also helped with *far*
              shorter timelines! As soon as you have a date in mind, drop me a
              message and we can check availability.

              Definitely! I'm based in Dunedin but I'm happy to travel around
              Otago and beyond for the right celebration. Travel costs may apply
              depending on distance.

              Our first catch-up is relaxed and pressure-free. It's a chance for
              us to meet, chat about what you're imagining for your ceremony,
              and see if we're a good fit. I'll walk you through how the process
              works and answer any questions you have. We can meet over coffee
              or hop on a video call - whatever suits you best!

              Of course! Personal vows are the best part of the ceremony. And if
              writing vows isn't your thing, that's completely fine, too; we'll
              find words together that feel right for both of you.

              Every ceremony is a little different, so I put together a quote
              based on what you need. The best way to get an idea of cost is to
              get in touch and tell me a bit about your plans. I'm always happy
              to have a no-obligation chat!
